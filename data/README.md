### Data files for CMakeCreator

These data files contain CMakeList.txt constructs that are used by CMakeCreator. 

The *.tpl files are used as Python string template files. Since the $ is a special character in a Python template file, it is escaped by the insertion of $$ wherever a $ is needed to express CMake syntax. 

The *.dat files are incorporated without modification.
